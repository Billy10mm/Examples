# Examples
Example Code that hopefully someone can use

Had a helluva time finding Quickfix examples written in Python.  Finally got my project completed and figured if nothing else, some line in here might help someone else with their project.  That said, my code is crap.  I know that.  I can live with it.  I'm not a developer. All I did was stay at a Holiday Inn Express one night back in 2008.
